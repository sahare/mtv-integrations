## Conclusion

The MTV Integrations project handles highly sensitive cross-cluster authentication and authorization operations. While the current implementation includes several security best practices, the identified threats require immediate attention, particularly around privilege escalation and credential protection.

Priority should be given to implementing least-privilege RBAC, enhancing container security, and establishing comprehensive audit logging. The high-privilege nature of the cluster-admin permissions granted by ClusterPermission resources represents the highest risk and should be addressed immediately.

Regular security assessments and continuous monitoring will be essential for maintaining the security posture of this critical infrastructure component.
