## üö® Critical Security Findings

### Immediate Attention Required
- **ClusterPermission Escalation**: Risk of full cluster compromise
- **Container Escape to Host**: Risk of host system compromise

### High Priority Issues  
- Service account token security (cluster-admin privileges)
- Certificate authority protection
- Secret exposure in logs and memory
- RBAC bypass vulnerabilities

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Recommendations Summary

### Immediate Actions
1. **Implement least privilege RBAC** - Replace cluster-admin with minimal permissions
2. **Enable container hardening** - AppArmor/SELinux, seccomp, read-only filesystem  
3. **Implement secret protection** - Log scrubbing, memory protection, integrity validation

### Implementation Priorities
- **Critical**: Container security, privilege reduction
- **High**: Audit logging, certificate security, token improvements
- **Medium**: Network security, webhook hardening, external secret management

## üìä Security Metrics

| Category | Current State | Target State | Priority |
|----------|---------------|--------------|----------|
| Authentication | Token rotation (60min) | Token binding + audit | High |
| Authorization | RBAC + webhook | Least privilege + workflows | Critical |
| Data Protection | TLS encryption | + Secret management | High |
| Monitoring | Basic logging | Comprehensive events | Medium |
| Container Security | Non-root execution | + Security profiles | Critical |
